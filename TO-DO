 - Hash table and Priority queue to make state tree/graph
 - Add previous movement (LRUD) to value_t struct
 - A* & GBFS
 * IDA*
 * Disjoint patterns DB
 - State constructor for program input

Disjoint patterns DB
--------------------
 * patterns generator for a given state: 1 7 5 4 2 6 8 0 3 -> 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 3
 * read about switch optimization
 * successors should tell if the movement touch a *tile or a important tile
 * complete pdb_bfs: insert state's pattern into db, get successors, get their patterns,
   check if they're alredy into the db, recursive call to pdb_bfs
